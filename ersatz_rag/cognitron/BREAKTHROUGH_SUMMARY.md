## 🚀 **KEY INNOVATIONS IMPLEMENTED**

### 1. **Medical-Grade Confidence Architecture**
```
User Query → Multi-Domain Retrieval → DeepConf Validation → Confidence-Gated Response
                     ↓
               Critical (>95%) → Store in Case Memory
               High (85-95%) → Display with validation note
               Medium (70-85%) → Display with uncertainty warning
               Low (<70%) → "I don't have enough information"
```

### 2. **Multi-Domain Intelligence Integration**
- **LEANN**: AST-aware code chunking preserves programming semantics
- **PageIndex**: Smart document chunking maintains structural meaning
- **DeepConf**: Quality validation ensures production-grade reliability
